        <h2>About This Portfolio</h2>
        <p>This website represents the skills and knowledge I have acquired during this semester. Feel free to look around my labs which include HTML, CSS, web design, media integration, and more. Each page is designed with the latest principles of modern web design, including a consistent layout and responsive design. Take a look at my journey from publishing web pages to creating interactive menus. Thank you for visiting, and enjoy exploring my work!</p>
