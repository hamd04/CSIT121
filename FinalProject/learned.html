            <h2>Reflections on the Project</h2>
            <p>This project has been both challenging and rewarding to finish. Among the biggest challenges was trying to ensure all the technical requirements were met while maintaining a clean, responsive design. Using HTML and CSS to structure and style the website required a lot of trial and error, especially when implementing the navigation bar and media queries for mobile devices. Although the whole process wasn’t easy, it was very satisfying when all of the pieces came together into one single, functional, aesthetically pleasing website. This project showed me the importance of planning a task in steps since the process generally was much easier this way.</p>

            <h2>Testing Experience</h2>
            <p>I had a good experience testing the website on different browsers and devices. I was reminded that font sizes, layout, and other things appeared different when considering any other browser or screen size. These differences pointed out the need for following responsive design principles like flexible grid layouts and media queries to attain the same kind of user experience. Testing also showed me how important the validation of HTML and CSS codes is in avoiding compatibility issues.</p>

            <h2>Course Reflections</h2>
            <p>Aside from HTML and CSS, this course taught me the fundamentals of excellent Web design, such as usability, and responsive layouts. I gained a deeper understanding of the principles behind good web design, including accessibility, usability, and responsive layouts. This course continued to introduce concepts that I was able to apply to my project. The hands on assignments and discussions really helped me with my understanding of the topics we covered. Overall, this course has provided me with a solid foundation in web development, and I look forward to building upon these skills in future.</p>
