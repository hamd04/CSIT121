            <p>In Lab 1, I learned the difference between local and remote files, practiced file management in VS Code, and published my first web page. In Lab 2, I explored HTML basics, learned how to structure text with tags, and validated my HTML files using an online tool to ensure correctness.</p>
            
            <h3>What I Learned</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Understanding the importance of file structure and management in web development.</li>
                <li>Learning the proper use of HTML elements and tags for structuring a web page.</li>
                <li>How to validate an HTML file to ensure it meets web standards.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Additional Insights</h3>
            <p>I also learned about validating HTML files using the W3C Validator, which made me more comfortable because it lets me know that my HTML documents were error-free and compliant with web standards.</p>
