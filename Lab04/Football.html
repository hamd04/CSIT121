    <h1>Football Image</h1>

    <img src="images/Football.webp" alt="Football Helmet On Field">

    <p><strong>Description of the Image:</strong> The image shows a player helmet on a football field with two teams in the background</p>
    
    <p><strong>Image File Type Information:</strong> The image I found is a WebP file type which allows for the page to load faster since the format is lighter compare to JPEG and PNG.</p>
    
    <p><strong>Why Did I Choose This Image?</strong> I chose this image because it represents my love for football. The helmet also appears to be a gold color which is the same helmet color as my favorite NFL team The San Francisco 49ers.</p>
