In Lab 2, I explored HTML basics, learned how to structure text with tags, and validated my HTML files using an online tool to ensure correctness.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Understanding the importance of file structure and management in web development.</li>
                <li>Learning the proper use of HTML elements and tags for structuring a web page.</li>

            <h3>Additional Insights</h3>
            <p>I also learned about validating HTML files using the W3C Validator, which made me more comfortable because it lets me know that my HTML documents were error-free and compliant with web standards.</p>

            <p>In Lab 3, I learned how CSS can make a big difference in terms of the visuals and feel of a website. By separating the style from the HTML code, I was able to make the site more attractive. I used different CSS selectors like IDs and classes to make it easy to actually apply the styles. By doing this, I was able to customize the page in an organized manner.</p>
